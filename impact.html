    <h2 class="header">Impact Training & Volunteering App - 300 Blankets</h2>
    <p class="p-info">Do you want to help people in your community who experience or are at risk of homelessness but you
      don’t know where to start and think you lack the skills to volunteer?<br>
      <br>Our group of 5 UX/UI Designers, discovered a not-for-profit organisation called 300 Blankets which we chose as
      our redesign project. We quickly realised that there was a larger opportunity to create an app for future
      volunteers to get involved, whilst offering educational modules to gain essential skills to apply throughout their
      work in the community.

      <h2 class="header">Heuristic Evaluation</h2>
      <p class="p-info">At first the 300 Blankets site presented with a clear layout & structure but we soon discovered
        many inconsistencies with buttons & patterns.</p>
      <p class="p-info">Another major problem with the site was that the white & orange colours failed WCAG AAA and AA
        accessibility standards.</p>
      <p class="p-info">We recieved comments that the site was lacking style & flow and felt a bit outdated, potentially
        leading to users not gaining an enjoyable, or informative experience.</p>

    <div class="info-center">
      <h2 class="header">User Testing</h2>
      <p class="p-info">We wanted to understand who our users were, their experience with volunteering & engaging with
        not-for-profits and their thoughts on what could be improved with the connection between nfps and potential
        future volunteers.</p>
      <p>Through our reserach, we wanted to find out:</p><br>
      <ul>
        <li class="tab">What our user looks like?</li>
        <li class="tab">What motivates someone to engage with a cause they believe in?</li>
        <li class="tab">How aware are people of not-for-profit organisations?</li>
        <li class="tab">What will assist in bringing greater awareness?</li>
        <li class="tab">Engagement with not-for-profits & in what ways?</li>
        <li class="tab">Awareness of homelessness rates in Australia</li>
        <li class="tab">Ways homelessness can be helped?</li>

  <section id="grid">
    <h3 class="list">Here are some insights from the interviews:</h3>
    <p class="insight_impact1">I am aware of the issue of homelessness and would like to get involved to make a
      difference in
      people's lives, but it's not always clear to me on how I can contribute.</p>
    <p class="insight_impact2">I think connecting with others is a great idea, but I would need to learn ways on how to
      communicate effectively with people before I feel confident to approach anyone on the streets.</p>
    <p class="insight_impact3">Having empathy and being aware of your surroundings is the most important starting point
      when
      deciding to help, but I also fear that more funding is needed to make real change.</p>

      <h2 class="header">Proto Persona</h2>
      <p class="p-info">Gabriel is a married sales rep from Melbourne Victoria, who enjoys the thought of volunteering
        and making more of an impact with causes he believes in, particularly homelessness.</p>
      <p class="p-info">Unfortunately, he does not feel confident in the skills he possesses and is unsure how to
        approach people while volunteering. He is also looking to be more aware of upcoming events from nfps he is
        engaged with, and feels being more aware would lead to him saving his own time by scheduling time where he can
        engage and volunteer.</p>

      <h2 class="header">Problem Statement</h2>
      <p class="p-info">By analysing and synthesising our collected data, we asked ourselves the following question:</p>
      <p>How might we raise awareness of the issue of homelessness, educate people on communication and engagement
        skills, and make it easy for people to get involved with a flexible volunteer calendar?</p>
