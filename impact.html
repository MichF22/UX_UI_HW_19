    <h2 class="header">Impact Training & Volunteering App - 300 Blankets</h2>
    <p class="p-info">Do you want to help people in your community who experience or are at risk of homelessness but you
      don’t know where to start & think you lack the skills to volunteer?<br>
      <br>Our group of 5 UX/UI Designers, discovered a not-for-profit organisation called 300 Blankets which we chose as
      our redesign project. We quickly realised that there was a larger opportunity to create an app for future
      volunteers to get involved, whilst offering educational modules to gain essential skills to apply throughout their
      work in the community.

    <div class="info-center">
      <h2 class="header">Heuristic Evaluation</h2>
      <p class="p-info">At first the 300 Blankets site presented with a clear layout & structure but we soon discovered
        many inconsistencies with buttons & patterns.</p>
      <p class="p-info">Another major problem with the site was that the white & orange colours failed WCAG AAA & AA
        accessibility standards.</p>
      <p class="p-info">We recieved comments that the site was lacking style & flow & felt a bit outdated, potentially
        leading to users not gaining an enjoyable, or informative experience.</p>

  <section id="grid">
    <div class="info-center">
      <h2 class="header">User Testing</h2>
      <p class="p-info">We wanted to understand who our users were, their experience with volunteering & engaging with
        not-for-profits & their thoughts on what could be improved with the connection between nfps & potential
        future volunteers.</p>
      <p>Through our reserach, we wanted to find out:</p><br>
      <ul>
        <li class="tab">What our user looks like</li>
        <li class="tab">What motivates someone to engage with a cause they believe in</li>

  <section id="grid">
    <h3 class="list">Here are some insights from the interviews:</h3>
    <p class="insight_impact1">I am aware of the issue of homelessness & would like to get involved to make a
      difference in people's lives, but it's not always clear to me on how I can contribute.</p>
    <p class="insight_impact2">I think connecting with others is a great idea, but I would need to learn ways on how to
      communicate effectively with people, before I feel confident to approach anyone on the streets.</p>
    <p class="insight_impact3">Having empathy & being aware of your surroundings is the most important starting point
      when deciding to help, but I also fear that more funding is needed to make real change.</p>

      <p class="p-info">Meet Gabriel, a married sales rep from Melbourne Victoria, who enjoys the thought of
        volunteering & making more of an impact with causes he believes in, particularly homelessness.</p>
      <p class="p-info">Unfortunately, he does not feel confident in the skills he possesses & is unsure how to
        approach people while volunteering. He is also looking to be more aware of upcoming events from nfps he is
        engaged with & feels being more aware would lead to him saving his own time by scheduling time where he can
        engage & volunteer.</p>

      <div class="info-left">
        <p class="statement_impact">How might we raise awareness of the issue of homelessness, educate people on

      <h2 class="header">Information Archeticture</h2>
      <p class="p-info">After conducting a user scenario test on the website, we discovered that the user finds it
        difficult to navigate through the website because of its complicated structure & repetative information.</p>
      <p class="p-info">Our first goal was to simplify information for the user. For this we listed all information at
        one place & categorised similar information under the same heading & eliminated things that were repetative.

      <p class="p-info">With a simplified version of the information architecture, we then created a user flow for the
        user to
        be able to navigate through the homepage of the website to download the Impact app & sign-up to volunteer. We
        conducted a feature analysis with the following areas standing out.</p>

        complemented each other. This colour scheme was actually inspired from the colours of a real blanket.</p>

    <p class="p-info">As we kept moving with the project, we saw an opportunity to really expand the offerings of the
      app, particularly in the training section. We also believed there would be room for watch support with customized
      notifications for events. Potentially even an Impact watch app.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="grid">
    <div class="info-center">
      <h3 class="header">Our next steps are:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li class="tab">Adding content within the training section, including support for video material</li>
        <li class="tab">Giving users the ability to set up chat groups, check for immediate availability for events</li>
        <li class="tab">Showing other 300 Blankets events to the calendar e.g. Soul Kitchen, music nights etc.</li>
        <li class="tab">Developing watch support with upcoming events alerts, nearby events, ping location & register on
          the go
        </li>
      </ul><br>
      <p class="p-info">This project was really enjoyable for all of us & a great learning experience particularly in
        how to create a multi modal offering & sell a product across both techniques.</p>
