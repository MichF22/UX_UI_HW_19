    <h2 class="header">Impact Training & Volunteering App - 300 Blankets</h2>
    <p class="p-info">Do you want to help people in your community who experience or are at risk of homelessness but you
      don’t know where to start and think you lack the skills to volunteer?<br>
      <br>Our group of 5 UX/UI Designers, discovered a not-for-profit organisation called 300 Blankets which we chose as
      our redesign project. We quickly realised that there was a larger opportunity to create an app for future
      volunteers to get involved, whilst offering educational modules to gain essential skills to apply throughout their
      work in the community.

    <p id="section_header">Research</p>
    <p class="p-info">We conducted a Heuristic Evaluation and redlining, followed by user interviews.

  <section id="grid">
    <div class="info-left">
      <h2 class="header">Heuristic Evaluation</h2>
      <p class="p-info">At first the 300 Blankets site presented with a clear layout & structure but we soon discovered
        many inconsistencies with buttons & patterns.</p>
      <p class="p-info">Another major problem with the site was that the white & orange colours failed WCAG AAA and AA
        accessibility standards.</p>
      <p class="p-info">We recieved comments that the site was lacking style & flow and felt a bit outdated, potentially
        leading to users not gaining an enjoyable, or informative experience.</p>

    <div class="impact_heuristic"></div>
  </section>

  <section id="grid">
    <div class="info-center">
      <h2 class="header">User Testing</h2>
      <p class="p-info">We wanted to understand who our users were, their experience with volunteering & engaging with
        not-for-profits and their thoughts on what could be improved with the connection between nfps and potential
        future volunteers.</p>
      <p>Through our reserach, we wanted to find out:</p><br>
      <ul>
        <li class="tab">What our user looks like?</li>
        <li class="tab">What motivates someone to engage with a cause they believe in?</li>
        <li class="tab">How aware are people of not-for-profit organisations?</li>
        <li class="tab">What will assist in bringing greater awareness?</li>
        <li class="tab">Engagement with not-for-profits & in what ways?</li>

        <li class="tab">Ways homelessness can be helped?</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="grid">
    <h3 class="list">Here are some insights from the interviews:</h3>
    <p class="insight_impact1">I am aware of the issue of homelessness and would like to get involved to make a
      difference in
      people's lives, but it's not always clear to me on how I can contribute.</p>
    <p class="insight_impact2">I think connecting with others is a great idea, but I would need to learn ways on how to
      communicate effectively with people before I feel confident to approach anyone on the streets.</p>
    <p class="insight_impact3">Having empathy and being aware of your surroundings is the most important starting point
      when
      deciding to help, but I also fear that more funding is needed to make real change.</p>

  </section>

  <section id="grid">
    <div class="info-left">
      <h2 class="header">Proto Persona</h2>
      <p class="p-info">Gabriel is a married sales rep from Melbourne Victoria, who enjoys the thought of volunteering
        and making more of an impact with causes he believes in, particularly homelessness.</p>
      <p class="p-info">Unfortunately, he does not feel confident in the skills he possesses and is unsure how to
        approach people while volunteering. He is also looking to be more aware of upcoming events from nfps he is
        engaged with, and feels being more aware would lead to him saving his own time by scheduling time where he can
        engage and volunteer.</p>

  </section>

  <section id="grid">
    <div class="info-center">
      <h2 class="header">Problem Statement</h2>
      <p class="p-info">By analysing and synthesising our collected data, we asked ourselves the following question:</p>
      <p>How might we raise awareness of the issue of homelessness, educate people on communication and engagement
        skills, and make it easy for people to get involved with a flexible volunteer calendar?</p>
  </section>

      <li class="tab">Volunteering</li>
      <li class="tab">Connecting</li>

    <div class="info-left">
      <h2 class="header">Information Archeticture</h2>
      <p class="p-info">After conducting a user scenario test on the website, we discovered that the user finds it
        difficult to navigate through the website because of its complicated structure and repetative information.</p>
      <p class="p-info">Our first goal was to simplify information for the user. For this we listed all information at
        one place and categorised similar information under the same heading and eliminated things that were repetative.

  <section id="grid">
    <div class="info-center">
      <h2 class="header">User Flow</h2>
      <p class="p-info">With a simplified version of the information architecture we created a user flow for the user to
        be able to navigate through the Homepage of the website to download the IMPACT app and sign up to volunteer. We conducted a feature analysis with the following areas standing out.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="info-left">
      <h3 class="header">Four key features emerged within the IMPACT app:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li class="tab">Volunteer/Calendar function to checkout and register for upcoming events</li>
        <li class="tab">Training function to gain information via quiz</li>

  </section>

  <section id="grid">
    <div class="info-left">
      <h2 class="header">UI Style Guide</h2>
      <p class="p-info">We chose a different colour scheme to the original website, where we opted for warm & welcoming
        colours but at the same time neutral for the app.</p>
      <p class="p-info">We arribed at a combination of warm red, blanket brown, calm earth & ocean blue that
        complemented each other. This colour scheme was acyually inspired from the colours of a real blanket.</p>
      <p class="p-info">In terms of typoraphy we used a combination of the Inter and Sintony styles where Inter was for
        headings and Sintony for paragraphs.</p>

  <section>
    <p id="section_header">Final Thoughts & Opportunities</p>
    <p class="p-info">As we kept moving with the project, we saw an opportunity to really expand the offerings of the
      app, particularly in the training section. We also believed there would be room for watch support with customized
      notifications for events. Potentially even an Impact watch app.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="grid">
    <div class="info-center">
      <h3 class="header">Next steps:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li class="tab">Adding content within the training section, including support for video material</li>
        <li class="tab">Giving users the ability to set up chat groups, check for immediate availability for events</li>
        <li class="tab">Showing other 300 Blankets events to the calendar e.g. Soul Kitchen, music nights etc.</li>
        <li class="tab">Watch support with upcoming events alerts, nearby events, ping location & register on the go
        </li>
      </ul><br>
      <p class="p-info">This project was really enjoyable for all of us, and a great learning experience particularly in
        how to create a multi modal offering and sell a product across both techniques.</p>
