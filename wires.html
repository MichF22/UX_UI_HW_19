        <p class="p-info">What would you do if you find an injured native animal?<br>
            <br>Our group of 4 UX/UI Designers, were wondering the same & we were pleased to discover a Not-for-profit
            organisation called WIRES, providing wildlife rescue services.

            <p class="p-info">Another major problem with the site was that the lime green and orange colours failed WCAG
                AAA and AA accessibility standards.</p>
