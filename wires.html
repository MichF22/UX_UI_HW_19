            <br>Our group of 4 UX/UI Designers, were wondering the same & we were pleased to discover a Not-for-profit
            organisation called WIRES, providing wildlife rescue services.

                navigation is simple but key features were hidden in the burger menu.</p>
            <p class="p-info">Another major problem with the site was that the lime green and orange colours failed WCAG
                AAA and AA accessibility standards.</p>
            <p class="p-info">Overall users commented that the styling looked a little amateurish and felt a bit

            <p class="p-info">We then conducted 10 user interviews to learn more about the different experiences people
                had navigating the site and to identify potential pain points.</p>

                site as well as testing out different color combinations before determining our color schemes and other
                UI elements. We also conducted some A/B testing to gain more insights as to which style others prefer.

            <h2 class="header">UI Style Guide</h2>
            <p class="p-info">Afterwards, a UI Style Guide was developed to solidify important UI elements of the
                website, including logo measurements, color scheme and typography. Based on our Color Accessibility
                results, we’ve decided to change the color scheme to a more earthy green and orange, while still
                adhering to accessibility guidelines by increasing the contrast between certain color combinations.</p>

        <p class="p-info">Following the development of our high fidelity prototype, we conducted user testing that

            <p class="p-info">After testing out this iteration with more users, we found that it was much easier for
                users to locate the Bushfire guidelines and it clearer to users that there were more content in the
                Homepage. Some users did mention that they would still prefer to search for information, which leads us

            We also felt that the search function needed improving as our initial analysis showed that the search
            results were unreliable.</p>
        <p>As for future opportunities, we feel that creating a members hub, where members could see their personalised
