        <p class="p-info">What would you do if you find an injured native animal?<br>
            <br>Our group of 4 UX/UI Designers, were wondering the same & we were pleased to discover a Not-for-profit
            organisation called WIRES, providing wildlife rescue services.

        <p class="p-info">The following Design Process was applied throughout our Project:
        </p>
        <ul class="hlinelist">
            <li>Research&nbsp; </li>
            <li>&bull;&nbsp;Define</li>

        <p id="section_header">Research</p>
        <p class="p-info">Since we were not familiar with the existing WIRES website we began with a Heuristic
            Evaluation of the existing elements.
        </p>

    <section id="grid">
        <div class="info-left">
            <h2 class="header">Heuristic Evaluation</h2>
            <p class="p-info">At first glance the homepage looks to be clearly laid out with good content grouping. The
                navigation is simple but key features were hidden in the burger menu.</p>
            <p class="p-info">Another major problem with the site was that the lime green and orange colours failed WCAG
                AAA and AA accessibility standards.</p>
            <p class="p-info">Overall users commented that the styling looked a little amateurish and felt a bit
                clinical.</p>

            <h2 class="header">User Testing</h2>
            <p class="p-info">We then conducted 10 user interviews to learn more about the different experiences people
                had navigating the site and to identify potential pain points.</p>
            <p>Through our reserach, we wanted to find out:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>how users are navigating the website & see if they can find the information they need</li>
                <li>are the users satisfied using the website</li>
                <li>can the users make a donation easily</li>
                <li>pain points the user encounters & learn what features work well and what can be improved on.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section id="grid">
        <h3 class="list">Here are some insights from the interviews:</h3>
        <p class="insight1">Difficult to identify WIRES’s Mission Statement & Values</p>
        <p class="insight2">Main services & offerings not highlighted enough</p>
        <p class="insight3">There was too much text, confusing wording & long forms</p>
        <p class="insight4">Search option was not effective</p>
        <p class="insight5">Labelling of buttons inconsistent</p>
        <p class="insight6">Lack alerting when leaving main site </p>

            <h2 class="header">Competitor Analysis</h2>
            <p class="p-info">Next, we conducted a Competitor Analysis of similar wildlife rescue and information
                website based on 4 main factors: Color scheme & accessibility, Text readability and Information layout,
                Navigation and Responsive design.</p>

            <h3>Some of our key findings were:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Simple information architecture and clear labelling is important for ease of navigation</li>
                <li>Responsive design is important to ensure that information does not get lost or hidden users are
                    viewing the

        <div class="info-left">
            <h2 class="header">Proto Persona</h2>
            <p class="p-info">This is Trudy, she’s a uni student studying Environmental Science. She has seen the
                affects that bushfires have had on native animals in her local area and wants to learn more about what
                she can do to help.</p>
            <p class="p-info">To demonstrate how Trudy would interact with the website, we created a User Journey of a
                scenario where Trudy found an injured possum in the wild.</p>

            <h2 class="header">User Testing</h2>
            <p class="p-info">By analysing and synthesising our collected data, we asked ourselves the following
                question:</p>
            <p class="p-info">How can we make it clearer & easier for users to find the relevant information on rescue
                animals?</p>

    <hr class="section_line">

    <section>
        <p id="section_header">Ideate</p>
        <p class="p-info">Next we created an Affinity Diagram of the user test results to group the data into common
            themes. Further analysis utilizing a Frequency Diagram was conducted to establish the core issues.</p>

            <h2 class="header">Card Sorting</h2>
            <p class="p-info">To the address navigational issues, card sorting was utilized to establish new groupings,
                labels and structure.The results were then used as the new primary and secondary navigation system for
                the websites header and a full version collated for the website footer.</p>

            <h3 class="header">Lo-Fi Wireframes</h3>
            <p class="p-info">Next, we created some low/mid-fidelity wireframes to determine the new structure of the
                site as well as testing out different color combinations before determining our color schemes and other
                UI elements. We also conducted some A/B testing to gain more insights as to which style others prefer.

    <section id="grid">
        <div class="info-center">
            <h3 class="header">UI Style Guide</h3>
            <p class="p-info">Afterwards, a UI Style Guide was developed to solidify important UI elements of the
                website, including logo measurements, color scheme and typography. Based on our Color Accessibility
                results, we’ve decided to change the color scheme to a more earthy green and orange, while still
                adhering to accessibility guidelines by increasing the contrast between certain color combinations.</p>
            <p class="p-info">We then applied the Style Guide to create the first iteration of our High Fidelity
                Wireframe.</p>
            <h3 class="header">Some of the key changes were: </h3>
            <p class="p-info">A simpler header navigation with 4 tabs instead of 10</p>
            <p class="p-info">More spacing and images between paragraphs to increase readability</p>
            <p class="p-info">Footer navigation with links to all pages in the site</p>

            <h3 class="header">Responsive Design</h3>
            <p class="p-info">To demonstrate the responsive design of the desktop to mobile wireframes were created and

    <section>
        <p id="section_header">Test</p>
        <p class="p-info">Following the development of our high fidelity prototype, we conducted user testing that
            included similar tasks as the initial tests performed on the WIRES website. We did this intentionally to
            gauge Whether we had improved the navigation, labeling and communication
            As well as other issues previously identified.</p>

    <section id="grid">
        <div class="info-center">
            <h3 class="header">Key findings:</h3>
            <p class="p-info">Users could quickly find important information such as the Emergency Rescue Number and
                Report a Rescue Form</p>
            <p class="p-info">It was a simple process to make a donation</p>
            <p class="p-info">Some users did not instinctively scroll down to find more information</p>
            <p class="p-info">Some headings in the dropdown menu were still ambiguous and it was not in every case easy
                to find the bushfires factsheet.</p>
